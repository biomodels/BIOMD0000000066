_Biomodels Curation:_ The model reproduces Fig 2f of the paper. The Vmax
values for different reactions are obtained by multiplying the specific
activites given in Table 3 of the paper with the protein concentration and an
assay correction factor that was provided by the authors. The protein
concentration is 202 mg/litre. The specific activities that need to be taken
into consideration are those given for "variable threonine" in Table 3. The
following are the assay correction factors provided by the authors: vak1=1.49;
vak3=1.12; vasd=1.14; vhsd=1.42; vts=1.15; vhk=1.13. The model was
successfully tested on MathSBML and Jarnac
